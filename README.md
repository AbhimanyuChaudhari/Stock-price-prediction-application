# Stock-price-prediction-application
It is a web application in which user can choose any model he wants to predict the stock price
Creating a web application that allows users to predict stock prices using different models and provides trends like weekly and monthly, with the use of Streamlit for the user interface, is a fantastic project. Here's an enhanced README document for your GitHub repository to provide a clear overview and guide for users and contributors:

# Stock Price Prediction Web Application

This repository contains a web application built using Streamlit that enables users to predict stock prices and analyze trends on a weekly and monthly basis. Users have the flexibility to choose the stock they want to predict and the model they want to use for predictions. 

## Features

- **Stock Selection**: Users can choose the stock they want to predict by entering the stock symbol or name.

- **Model Selection**: Users can choose from various machine learning models for stock price prediction, such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Time Series models (ARIMA, LSTM, etc.).

- **Prediction**: The application provides stock price predictions based on the selected model.

- **Trends**: Users can analyze stock price trends on a weekly and monthly basis to gain insights into the stock's performance.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Interactive charts are provided for visualizing historical and predicted stock prices, making it easy for users to understand the data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the web application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction-app.git
   cd stock-price-prediction-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web Application**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## Usage

1. **Select Stock**:
   - Enter the stock symbol or name of the stock you want to predict.

2. **Select Model**:
   - Choose the machine learning model you want to use for prediction from the available options.

3. **Predict**:
   - Click the "Predict" button to see the stock price prediction.

4. **Analyze Trends**:
   - You can visualize and analyze the stock's weekly and monthly trends to gain insights.

## Models

This application currently supports the following machine learning models for stock price prediction:

This application currently supports the following machine learning models for stock price prediction:

- **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a simple yet powerful model for predicting continuous values.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**: KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that can be used for regression tasks.

- **Random Forest Regression**: Random Forest is an ensemble method known for its accuracy and robustness in regression problems.

- **Naive Bayes Model**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic model, and it can be adapted for regression tasks.

- **Gradient Boosting**: Gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, are known for their high predictive power in regression tasks.

- **Decision Tree Regression**: Decision trees can be used for regression, providing interpretable results.

## Deployment
